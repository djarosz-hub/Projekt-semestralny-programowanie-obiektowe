# Projekt-semestralny-programowanie-obiektowe

WPF-based application created for managing the database created in the first semester of college.
Application requires local SQL Server and .NET FRAMEWORK 4.7.2. installed to work properly.
Database source file is attached in main folder (Mydb.txt).
If using Visual Studio create db locally:
1. Choose new query (placed in SQL Server Object Explorer -> Your local sql server) and execute code attached in Mydb.txt
2. In Server Explorer add new Data Connection to database (basically server name is: (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB and choose Mydb from combobox below), test your connection, then add.
3. Build and enjoy using app.
